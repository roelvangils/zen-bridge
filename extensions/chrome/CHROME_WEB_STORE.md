```

**Description**: (Required, max 16,000 characters)

```markdown
# Inspekt - Command Line Browser Automation

Control your browser from the terminal with AI-powered automation. Execute JavaScript, automate tasks, and interact with any website using natural language commands.

## 🚀 Key Features

🔒 **Secure & User-Controlled** - Explicit opt-in required for each domain. You choose which websites Zen can access.

✨ **Works on ALL Websites** - Uses proper extension APIs to work on GitHub, Gmail, banking sites, and more (with your permission)

🤖 **AI-Powered Automation** - Use natural language commands like "click login button" or "fill out the form"

⚡ **DevTools Integration** - Store inspected elements with `zenStore($0)` and manipulate them from CLI

🔒 **100% Local** - All communication stays between your browser and local CLI. No cloud, no tracking, complete privacy.

🛠️ **Developer-Friendly** - Perfect for web scraping, testing, automation, and rapid prototyping

## 🔐 Security First

**You're in control:** Zen Bridge requires your explicit permission before accessing any website.

1. Visit a new website → Permission modal appears
2. Review what access means → Allow or deny
3. Permission saved → Manage anytime from extension popup
4. Full transparency → See all allowed domains

Only websites YOU explicitly allow can be controlled from the CLI. Revoke access anytime.

## 📝 Quick Start

1. **Install the Extension** - Click "Add to Chrome"
2. **Install Zen CLI**:
   ```bash
   pip install zen-bridge
   ```
3. **Start the Server**:
   ```bash
   inspektserver start
   ```
4. **Run Commands**:
   ```bash
   inspekteval "document.title"
   inspektdo "click login button"
   inspektdescribe
   ```

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Web Automation**: Automate repetitive browser tasks
- **Testing**: Test web applications from the command line
- **Data Extraction**: Extract data from websites programmatically
- **Debugging**: Execute JavaScript directly from your terminal
- **Prototyping**: Quickly test ideas without writing full scripts

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

- ✅ **Open Source** - Full transparency, review our code on GitHub
- ✅ **Local Only** - No data sent to external servers
- ✅ **No Tracking** - Zero analytics or data collection
- ✅ **Your Data Stays Yours** - All processing happens locally

## 💡 Example Commands

```bash
# Get page information
inspektinfo

# Extract all links
inspektlinks

# Natural language interaction
inspektdo "scroll to bottom"
inspektdo "click the blue button"

# AI-powered page description
inspektdescribe

# Execute custom JavaScript
inspekteval "document.querySelector('h1').textContent"

# Store element from DevTools
# 1. Inspect element (Right-click → Inspect)
# 2. In console: zenStore($0)
# 3. In terminal: inspektinspected
```

## 🌟 Why Extension Over Userscript?

Many websites (GitHub, Gmail, banking sites) use Content Security Policy (CSP) that blocks userscripts. This extension uses Chrome's built-in APIs with proper permissions to bypass CSP safely and legally.

---

**Note**: This extension requires the Zen Bridge CLI to be installed separately. The extension provides the browser-side component that communicates with your local CLI.
```

**Category**: (Required)
```
Developer Tools
```

**Language**: (Required)
```
English (United States)
```

### Privacy Practices

**Single Purpose Description**: (Required)
```
This extension enables command-line control of Chrome for browser automation, testing, and web interaction by establishing a local WebSocket connection between the browser and a CLI tool.
```

**Permission Justifications**: (Required)

You need to justify each permission in manifest.json:

**activeTab**:
```
Required to execute JavaScript in the currently active tab for browser automation and command execution.
```

**scripting**:
```
Required to inject and execute code with proper CSP bypass capabilities, enabling the extension to work on all websites including those with strict Content Security Policies. Users must explicitly allow each domain before the extension can access it.
```

**storage**:
```
Required to store user's domain permissions. The extension requires users to explicitly allow each domain before it can be controlled from the CLI. This list of allowed domains is stored locally using chrome.storage.sync.
```

**host_permissions (<all_urls>)**:
```
Required to inject the content script that displays the permission modal on all websites. The content script only establishes a connection AFTER the user explicitly allows the domain. Users maintain full control over which domains the extension can access.
```

**Data Usage**: (Required)

Check the appropriate boxes:

**Does this extension collect user data?**
```
No
```

If you check "Yes", you'll need to explain what data and why. Since Zen Bridge doesn't collect any data, select **No**.

**Data Usage Certification**:
```
✅ I certify that this extension complies with Chrome Web Store policies
✅ I certify that the disclosure practices are accurate
```

### Pricing & Distribution

**Pricing**:
```
Free
```

**Distribution**:
```
Public (visible to everyone on Chrome Web Store)
```

**Regions**:
```
All regions
```

### Store Listing Assets

Upload the assets you created:

1. **Icon** - 128x128px (auto-pulled from manifest, verify it looks good)
2. **Screenshots** - Upload 1-5 screenshots (1280x800px)
3. **Small promo tile** - 440x280px
4. **Large promo tile** - 920x680px (optional)
5. **Marquee** - 1400x560px (optional)
6. **Video** - YouTube link (optional)

## Privacy & Permissions

### Privacy Policy (Required)

You need a privacy policy URL. Create a page on your documentation site or GitHub:

**Example**: `https://roelvangils.github.io/zen-bridge/privacy-policy/`

**Privacy Policy Content**:

```markdown
# Privacy Policy - Inspekt

**Last Updated**: [Date]

## Data Collection

Inspekt does NOT collect, store, or transmit any user data. The extension operates entirely locally on your machine.

## How It Works

1. The extension establishes a WebSocket connection to `localhost:8766`
2. All communication stays between your browser and local CLI
3. No data is sent to external servers
4. No analytics or tracking

## Permissions

The extension requires these permissions:

- **activeTab**: To execute commands in the active browser tab
- **scripting**: To inject code with CSP bypass (core functionality)
- **<all_urls>**: To work on all websites

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality and no data is collected or transmitted.

## Third-Party Services

This extension does NOT use any third-party services, analytics, or tracking.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy. Changes will be posted at this URL with an updated date.

### What Happens Next

**Timeline**:
- Initial review: Usually 1-3 business days
- May take longer for first submission or complex extensions

**Possible Outcomes**:

1. **Approved** ✅
   - Extension goes live on Chrome Web Store
   - You'll receive an email notification

2. **Rejected** ❌
   - You'll receive specific feedback on what needs to be changed
   - Common reasons:
     - Missing or inadequate privacy policy

### Common Rejection Reasons (and How to Avoid)

**1. Insufficient Permission Justification**
